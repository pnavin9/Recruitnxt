# Notebook Files README

This repository contains several Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a different machine learning algorithm or technique. Below is a brief description of each notebook:

1. **adaboost-m.ipynb**: This notebook implements the AdaBoost algorithm. AdaBoost is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.

2. **adaboost.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates the AdaBoost algorithm with optuna.

3. **catboost.ipynb**: This notebook showcases the CatBoost algorithm. CatBoost is a gradient boosting library that is particularly effective for categorical features.

4. **logistic-regression.ipynb**: This notebook implements logistic regression, a linear classification algorithm used for binary classification tasks.

5. **piramal-svm.ipynb**: This notebook explores Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

6. **random-forest.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates the Random Forest algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees.

7. **xgboost-optuna.ipynb**: This notebook combines the XGBoost algorithm with Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework. XGBoost is an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting.

Feel free to explore these notebooks to learn more about different machine learning algorithms and techniques. Each notebook contains explanations, code, and sometimes visualizations to help you understand and implement the algorithms effectively.

If you have any questions or need assistance with any of the notebooks, please feel free to reach out!
